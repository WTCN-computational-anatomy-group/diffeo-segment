# Multi-Brain: Unified segmentation of population neuroimaging data

## Overview
This repository contains the Multi-Brain (MB) model, which has the general aim of integrating a number of disparate image analysis components within a single unified generative modelling framework (segmentation, nonlinear registration, image translation, etc.). The model is described in Brudfors et al [2020], and it builds on a number of previous works. Its objective is to achieve diffeomorphic alignment of a wide variaty of medical image modalities into a common anatomical space. This involves the ability to construct a "tissue probability template" from a population of scans through group-wise alignment [Ashburner & Friston, 2009; Blaiotta et al, 2018]. Diffeomorphic deformations are computed within a *geodesic shooting* framework [Ashburner & Friston, 2011], which is optimised with a Gauss-Newton strategy that uses a multi-grid approach to solve the system of linear equations [Ashburner, 2007]. Variability among image contrasts is modelled using a much more sophisticated version of the Gaussian mixture model with bias correction framework originally proposed by Ashburner & Friston [2005], and which has been extended to account for known variability of the intensity distributions of different tissues [Blaiotta et al, 2018]. This model has been shown to provide a good model of the intensity distributions of different imaging modalities [Brudfors et al, 2019]. Time permitting, additional registration accuracy through the use of shape variability priors [Balbastre et al, 2018] will also be incorporated.

## OBS 
Please ensure that: (1) the folder containing this repository (`diffeo-segment`) is placed in the `toolbox` folder of your SPM version; and (2), the folder is renamed to `mb`. 

## Dependencies
The algorithm is developed using MATLAB and relies on external functionality from the SPM12 software. The following folders are therefore required downloads and need to be placed on the MATLAB search path (using `addpath`):
* **SPM12:** Download from https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/download/.
* **Shoot toolbox:** The Shoot folder from the toolbox directory of SPM12.
* **Longitudinal toolbox:** The Longitudinal folder from the toolbox directory of SPM12.

## Example use cases
This section contains example code demonstrating how the MB toolbox can be used for nonlinear image registration, spatial normalisation, tissue segmentation and bias-field correction. **Example 1** learns (or fits) the MB model from a population of MRI scans. Learning the MB model results in a bunch of tissue segmentations, bias-field corrected scans and forward deformations, aligning a template to each subject's scan (a combined nonlinear and rigid registration). The deformations can be used to warp a subject image to template space, or aligning two subjects' images together by composing their deformations. These two operations are demonstrated in **Example 2**. Finally, **Example 3** fits an already learned MB model to two subject MRIs. This is equivalent to registering to a pre-existing common space. Warping can then be done as shown in Example 2. For a full description of the model settings, see `demo_mb.m`.

### 1. Learning the MB model
``` matlab
% This script fits the MB model to a population of MRIs. It is a
% group-wise image registration where an optimal K class tissue template is 
% built, as well as optimal intensity parameters learnt. The resulting
% deformations (written to dir_out prefixed y_) can then be used to warp
% between subject scans. Also native and template space tissue
% segmentaitons are written to disk, as well as a bias-field corrected 
% versions of the input scans.

% Data directory, assumed to contain MRI nifti images of the same contrast.
dir_data = '/directory/with/some/MRIs';

% Get paths to data
pth_im  = spm_select('FPList',dir_data,'^.*\.nii$'); % Selects all nifti files in dir_data

% RUN module (fits  the model)
run              = struct;
run.mu.create.K  = 5;                        % Number of classes in the TPMs. The actual TPMs will contain one more (implicit) class
run.mu.create.vx = 1.5;                      % Voxel size of the template -> smaller == faster, but less precise
run.onam         = 'mb_test';                % A name for the model
run.odir         = {'mb-output'};            % Output directory (to write model files)
run.nworker      = Inf;                      % Number of parallel workers
run.save         = true;                     % Save model at each 'epoch'
run.gmm(1).chan(1).images = cellstr(pth_im); % Image files

% OUT module (writes different outputs)
out        = struct;
out.result = {fullfile(run.odir{1},  ['mb_fit_' run.onam '.mat'])};
out.c      = 1:run.mu.create.K + 1;  % write classes in native space
out.wc     = 1:run.mu.create.K + 1;  % write classes in template space
out.mwc    = 1:run.mu.create.K + 1;  % write classes in modulated template space
out.sm     = 1:run.mu.create.K + 1;  % write scalar momentum

% Run jobs
jobs{1}.spm.tools.mb.run = run;
jobs{2}.spm.tools.mb.out = out;
spm_jobman('run', jobs);
```

### 2. Warping with MB deformations
``` matlab
% This script demonstrates warping with the deformation generated from
% fitting the MB model. The template file generated by MB, plus two subject 
% scans with their corresponding forward deformations (prefixed 'y_') are
% needed. The following three warps are demonstrated:
% 1. Warp an image to template space.
% 2. Warp the template to image space.
% 3. Warp one image to another image.

% Path to a MB tissue template (this is dir_out in Example 1)
pth_mu = fullfile(dir_out,'mu_mb_test.nii');
% Paths to two subject MRIs to which MB has been fitted
pth_img1 = '/directory/with/some/MRIs/img1.nii';
pth_img2 = '/directory/with/some/MRIs/img2.nii';
% Paths to corresponding forward deformations of the above subjects
pth_y1 = fullfile(dir_out,'/y_img1.nii');
pth_y2 = fullfile(dir_out,'y_img2.nii');
% Where to write the warped images
dir_out = 'warped';

% 1. Use forward deformation (pth_y1) to warp image 1 (pth_img1) to 
%    template space (pth_mu)
% -----------------
matlabbatch = {};
matlabbatch{1}.spm.util.defs.comp{1}.inv.comp{1}.def     = {pth_y1};
matlabbatch{1}.spm.util.defs.comp{1}.inv.space           = {pth_mu};
matlabbatch{1}.spm.util.defs.out{1}.pull.fnames          = {pth_img1};
matlabbatch{1}.spm.util.defs.out{1}.pull.savedir.saveusr = {dir_out};
matlabbatch{1}.spm.util.defs.out{1}.pull.interp          = 1;
matlabbatch{1}.spm.util.defs.out{1}.pull.mask            = 1;
matlabbatch{1}.spm.util.defs.out{1}.pull.fwhm            = [0 0 0];
matlabbatch{1}.spm.util.defs.out{1}.pull.prefix          = 'w';
spm_jobman('run',matlabbatch);

% 2. Use forward deformation (pth_y1) to template (pth_mu) to  image 
%    space (pth_img1) 
% -----------------
matlabbatch = {};
matlabbatch{1}.spm.util.defs.comp{1}.comp{1}.def         = {pth_y1};
matlabbatch{1}.spm.util.defs.comp{1}.space               = {pth_img1};
matlabbatch{1}.spm.util.defs.out{1}.pull.fnames          = {pth_mu};
matlabbatch{1}.spm.util.defs.out{1}.pull.savedir.saveusr = {dir_out};
matlabbatch{1}.spm.util.defs.out{1}.pull.interp          = 1;
matlabbatch{1}.spm.util.defs.out{1}.pull.mask            = 1;
matlabbatch{1}.spm.util.defs.out{1}.pull.fwhm            = [0 0 0];
matlabbatch{1}.spm.util.defs.out{1}.pull.prefix          = 'w';
spm_jobman('run',matlabbatch);

% 3. Compose both forward deformations (pth_y1, pth_y2) via template space
%    to register image 2 (pth_img2) to image 1 (pth_img1).
% -----------------
matlabbatch = {};
matlabbatch{1}.spm.util.defs.comp{1}.inv.comp{1}.def     = {pth_y2};
matlabbatch{1}.spm.util.defs.comp{1}.inv.space           = {pth_mu};
matlabbatch{1}.spm.util.defs.comp{2}.def                 = {pth_y1};
matlabbatch{1}.spm.util.defs.out{1}.pull.fnames          = {pth_img2};
matlabbatch{1}.spm.util.defs.out{1}.pull.savedir.saveusr = {dir_out};
matlabbatch{1}.spm.util.defs.out{1}.pull.interp          = 1;
matlabbatch{1}.spm.util.defs.out{1}.pull.mask            = 1;
matlabbatch{1}.spm.util.defs.out{1}.pull.fwhm            = [0 0 0];
matlabbatch{1}.spm.util.defs.out{1}.pull.prefix          = 'w';
spm_jobman('run',matlabbatch);
```

### 3. Fitting a learned MB model
``` matlab
% This script demonstrates how to fit a learned MB model (template and 
% intensity prior) to new data. In practice, it only involves modifying
% some settings in Example 1.

% Path to results MAT-file generated by fitting MB
pth_fit = fullfile(dir_out,'mb_fit_mb_test.mat');

% Make intensity prior file by extracting information from pth_fit
load(pth_fit,'sett'); 
pr      = sett.gmm.pr; 
mg_ix   = sett.gmm.mg_ix; 
save('prior_mb.mat','pr','mg_ix');

% Add the following fields to the RUN module of Example 1:
run.mu.exist           = {pth_mu};
run.gmm.pr.file        = {pth_int_prior};
run.gmm.pr.hyperpriors = [];  % Avoids re-learning the intensity prior
% and remove run.mu.create.K and run.mu.create.vx
```
